# User-behavior-investigation-by-A-A-B-testing-
- Project description
You work at a startup that sells food products. You need to investigate user behavior for the company's app. The designers would like to change the fonts for the entire app, but the managers are afraid the users might find the new design intimidating. They decide to make a decision based on the results of an A/A/B test. The users are split into three groups: two control groups get the old fonts and one test group gets the new ones. Find out which set of fonts produces better results.
